\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

The last few years have seen great advances in speech recognition. Much of this progress is due to the resurgence of neural networks; most speech systems now rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) with millions of parameters~\cite{dahl+etal_taslp12,hinton+etal_spm2012}.
However, as the complexity of these models has grown, so has their reliance on labelled training data. Currently, system development requires large corpora of transcribed speech audio data, texts for language modelling, and pronunciation dictionaries.
Despite speech applications becoming available in more languages, it is hard to imagine that resource collection at the required scale would be possible for all 7000 languages spoken in the world today.

I really like apples.

\section{Section heading}

This is some section with two table in it: Table~\ref{tbl:exemplars} and Table~\ref{tbl:abx_speaker}.

This is a new page, showing what the page headings looks like, and showing how to refer to a figure like Figure~\ref{fig:cae_siamese}.

    (a) The cAE as used in this chapter. The encoding layer (blue) is chosen based on performance on a development set.
    (b) The cAE with symmetrical tied weights. The encoding from the middle layer (blue) is always used.
    (c) The siamese DNN. The cosine distance between aligned frames (green and red) is either minimized or maximized depending on whether the frames belong to the same (discovered) word or not.
