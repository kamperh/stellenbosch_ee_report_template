## Overview

A LaTeX template for reports following the guidelines of the E&E department at
Stellenbosch University.


## Options

By (un)commenting the appropriate lines in the title page file
(`frontmatter/title_page.tex`), the front page can follow the format for:

- Skripsie (i.e. final year project) reports
- MEng (research) theses
- MEng (structured) research assignments
- PhD dissertations

You can also use alternative small-cap headings by:

- Commenting out the `% Headings` section in the root LaTeX file
  (`stellenbosch_ee_report.tex`) and uncommenting the subsequent code block for
  the alternative headings.
- (Un)commenting the appropriate line for formatting the title in the
  `frontmatter/title_page.tex` file.
