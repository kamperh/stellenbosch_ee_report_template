## Overview

A LaTeX template for reports, theses and dissertations following the guidelines
of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Stellenbosch
University.

You can directly open the template on
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jgnvncctghrr#afd824).


## Options

By (un)commenting the appropriate lines in the title page file
(`frontmatter/title_page.tex`), the front page can follow the format for:

- Skripsie (i.e. final year project) reports
- MEng (research) theses
- MEng (structured) research assignments
- PhD dissertations

Similarly the the `frontmatter/declaration.tex` page need to fit the degree: at
Stellenbosch, it is a "master's thesis" while it is a "PhD dissertation".
